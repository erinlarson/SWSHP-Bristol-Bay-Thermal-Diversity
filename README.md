# SWSHP-Bristol-Bay-Thermal-Diversity

Project funded by Southwest Alaska Salmon Habitat Partnership. Collaboration between R. Shaftel (ACCS-UAA), E. Schoen (IARC-UAF), and Sue Mauger (Cook Inletkeeper).

Other contributors include Dustin Merrigan (ACCS), Ben Meyer (KWF), and Will Samuel (UAF).

Project Title: Bristol Bay regional analysis of thermal diversity supporting salmon populations and life-histories

Project Location: Bristol Bay region including Togiak, Wood River, Nushagak Bay, Upper and Lower Nushagak River, Mulchatna River, Lake Clark, Iliamna, and Naknek watersheds

Proposed Accomplishment Summary:
The proposed work will summarize empirical temperature data collected across the Bristol Bay region, characterize thermal regimes supporting salmon life-histories, and model the effects of thermal regimes on juvenile salmon growth potential. This project will focus on differences across distinct Bristol Bay populations including lake spawning Sockeye and stream spawning Chinook and Coho salmon.
